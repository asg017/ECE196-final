# ECE 196 Final Project - N.S.A.

A glove that controls a robotic arm.

This repository contains code that was used in creating our final project for eCE 196.

Our project was creating a glove that contained sensors that controlled the PiB Robitic Arm. Most of the code hosted here is for the sensors that interacted with the Arduino (EMG, gyroscope/acceleromter, flex sesnors, etc.).

Our full documentation for this project can be find in our final report.

There's also miscellaneous files for other things (EAGLE, etc.).
